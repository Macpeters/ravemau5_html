# Ravemau5 Html build

## What is this?
This is a hobby game project I tinker with when I have the time and inclination.  It's a platformer where you play a Mau5 looking for rave. 

## How to Play
 
 **Controls:** I built it to be mobile friendly (there's a soft joystick), but I mostly test it on my laptop, so you might prefer using the arrow and space keys to move around


**Current Build:** [Playable Online Here](https://trusting-albattani-040749.netlify.com/)


## Plans
* the slime baddies can't be killed currently - I should give Ravemau5 some kind of laser weapon to shoot with
* graphics: they all need an overhaul - working on learning how to animate so I can do that properly
* I made it so you can unlock worlds/levels/characters, but that's currently wide open.  I'm not sure if I'll put that stuff back, since I'm unlikely to monetise this game


## Source Code
* the code here is generated by Gamemaker Studio 2 - if you want to see the code that's used to actually build the game, then check out that project: [Ravemau5](https://github.com/Macpeters/ravemau5)
